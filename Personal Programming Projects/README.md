## About Me
A characteristic I value and appreciate is the ability to convey a story, which can come in many forms. Whether it's a videogame being an expression of imagination, an anime acting as a commentary on the historical context of what it means to be a man in Japan, or simply sharing an experience as an expression of community.

As far as a form of expression that's marketable and I'm passionate about, it would be my skillset as a Data Scientist which I believe encompasses my strengths on a personal and technical level. The technical capability to build models, perform data analysis, and visualize the data; while having the communication ability to present those findings. Additionally, the online tech community is thriving and stronger than ever, so there are always folks who are willing to discuss many topics in relation to data science.

Some personal interests of mine
- An on-and-off relationship with guitar and singing
- Videogames, exploration of the business/developer aspects and playing them 
- Painting, an interest stemming from many years of watching Bob Ross
- Golf and Baseball
- Content exploration on YouTube, for the purposes of developing a general idea on a topic or learning about different perspectives on the same topic
