## About Me

-----
Personal Mission Statement:

I'm seeking a professional environment where a good plan sets the foundation for a job well done. Where colleagues seek to improve one another through mutual respect, comradery, and hard work. I hope to be part of an experience that I can look back at with pride, for the work I've done and the people I've worked with.

-----

My education began as an aspiring scientist, majoring in various branches of Chemistry and Biology as an undergraduate at the University of Colorado at Boulder. I eventually had the opportunity to utilize software and programming languages for various experiments.  Fostering that interest in programming and leveraging computing power has led me to where I am today, with a deep well of curiosity and awe at potential opportunities to make a quantifiable impact by generating insight from data.  

I value and appreciate the ability to convey a story through expression, coming in many forms. Whether it's a videogame being an expression of imagination, an anime as a commentary on the historical context of being a man in Japan, or simply sharing an experience as an expression of community.

A form of expression I'm passionate about developing would be my skillset as a Data Scientist, which encompasses my strengths on a personal and technical level. 

Additionally, the online tech community is thriving and stronger than ever, so there are always folks willing to discuss a variety of tech-related topics to aid in building clarity and perspective.

Some personal interests of mine
- An on-and-off relationship with guitar and singing
- Videogames, exploration of the business/developer aspects and playing them 
- Painting, an interest stemming from many years of watching Bob Ross
- Golf, Baseball, and Rollerblading
- Content exploration on YouTube, to challenge my own perspectives or simply learn about something new
