# Background
The project is a simulated text-adventure maze game. The theme takes light inspiration from Greek
mythology,specifically the Labyrinth and the Minotaur. While not a literal maze, the game attempts
to give the player the sense of being in one (a very simple one).

In reference to the Midterm Project rubric on Canvas, the maze is constructed of several functions
consisting of multiple variables (local and global). Additionally, there exists control flow blocks
(e.g. if statements and for loops), that also call on external functions. Naturally, not every function
in the game will have every single aspect previously stated simultaneously, but spread across the code
to provide the goal user experience. Strings throughout are manipulated in various ways
(e.g. prompts, text for user instructions/experience, being added to a list ,etc.).

With the goal of adding some variety to user experience, a list is used as data storage to simulate
a non-viewable player inventory. Additionally a coin toss sub-game is utilized in the final stage
of the game.
