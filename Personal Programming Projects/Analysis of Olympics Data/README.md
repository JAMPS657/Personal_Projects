# Exploration of Olympics Data 
## Data Sets Utilized
1. Primary Data - Olympic Events

The data was scraped from a web domain known as "sportsreference.com" and contians data on athletes and the events they participated in for both the Summer and Winter Seasons

2. Supplementary Data - National Olympic Committee Regions
The data contains nations that have records of taking part in the Olympics

## Initial Background

The concept(s) used in my final project is mainly Data Visualization of a large, pre-scraped dataset of the
Olympic Games from 1896 - 2016. There is the reading in of files, but not with File I/O, instead the
library pandas is utilized to read in the csv files.

The goal of the final project is attempt to utilize Python to simply explore, clean, organize, and visualize
a large data set (one I would typically use excel or Rstudio to analyze).

The structure of the project/code is as follows, I will read in and merge two csv files that were provided
during the submission of the final project, please save them to your directory. The code will read and merge
the csv files. From that point, we will have our raw data set to work with and approach the available data
through various perspectives in order to gain some sort of guided understanding.

Lastly, I have included BOTH coding comments (for those who can view the code) as well as "viewer" comments
displayed as the various analysis are run. This serves 2 purposes, the first is to make sense of the project
from a coding perspective; but also to make the analysis logical for someone who is just seeing the results
of the code being ran. Otherwise, it would appear that the program isn't doing anything at all.

## Important Caveat
To have code run as expected, the following must be done
"Ctrl+a" = to select everything THEN "Alt+shift+e" = to run code
The instructions listed above will allow ALL figures to be viewable simultaneously
