## About Me

-----
Personal Mission Statement:

I'm seeking a professional environment where a well laid strategy sets the foundation for a job well done. Where colleagues seek to improve one another through mutual respect, comradery, and hard work. I hope to be part of an experience that I can look back at with pride, for the work I've done and the people I've worked with.

My education began as an aspiring scientist, majoring in various branches of Chemistry and Biology as an undergraduate at the University of Colorado at Boulder. I eventually had the opportunity to utilize software and programming languages for various experiments.  Fostering that interest in programming and leveraging computing power has led me to where I am today, with a deep well of curiosity and awe at potential opportunities to make a quantifiable impact by generating insight from data.  

I value and appreciate the ability to convey a story through expression, coming in many forms. Whether it's a videogame being an expression of imagination, an anime as a commentary on the historical context of being a man in Japan, or simply sharing an experience as an expression of community.

A form of expression I'm passionate about developing would be my skillset as a Data Scientist, which encompasses my strengths on a personal and technical level. 

Additionally, the online tech community is thriving and stronger than ever, so there are always folks willing to discuss a variety of tech-related topics to aid in building clarity and perspective.

Some personal interests of mine
- An on-and-off relationship with guitar and singing
- Videogames, exploration of the business/developer aspects and playing them 
- Painting, an interest stemming from many years of watching Bob Ross
- Golf, Baseball, and Rollerblading
- Content exploration on YouTube, to challenge my own perspectives or simply learn about something new
