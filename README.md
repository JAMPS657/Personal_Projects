## Background
My educational journey began as an aspiring scientist, of the biological and chemical variety. As an undergraduate at the University of Colorado at Boulder, I majored in various branches of Chemistry and Biology. It wasn't until later in my undergraduate program that I had the opportunity to utilize software and programming languages for various experiments.  Fostering that interest in programming has led me to where I am today, with the desire to become a different kind of scientist.
